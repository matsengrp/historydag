.. currentmodule:: historydag

Description
-----------

This page documents the API for the ``historydag`` package.
The fundamental data structure implemented here is the :class:`HistoryDag`.
This data structure provides efficient storage for collections of trees with
internal node labels. In this package, we refer to such a tree as a *history*.
A history can be represented as a tree-shaped :class:`HistoryDag` object.

This package provides functions for:

* creating histories from tree data,
* merging histories together to create history DAGs,
* doing efficient computation on collections of histories stored in history DAGs, and
* accessing histories contained in a history DAG, and exporting them to other
  tree formats.
