# HistoryDAG

This package provides an implementation for a history DAG object, which
compactly expresses a collection of internally labeled trees which share
a common set of leaf labels.

This is a very preliminary implementation.
Eventually all methods will support arbitrary labels, but currently many
methods assume that labels are nucleotide sequences.
